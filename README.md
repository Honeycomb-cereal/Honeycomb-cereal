Hi, Honeycomb-Cereal here.

Yes, it is subjectively the best cereal.

I currently am operating in an amateur Full Stack Development capacity.

Additionally, I work on Godot and Web App projects.

If you're here because you know me from Hollywood, no you don't.

If you feel incensed to critique my code, please send it to me directly. I love learning.
